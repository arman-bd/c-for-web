## 2. Usage

### 2.1. Generating Project

First download or clone this repository in your development environment.
Use `cmake` to generate project on your preffered IDE.
We recommend using `Code::Blocks`

Open `terminal` inside the directory or use `cd` to navigate.

```bash
mkdir cb_project
cd cb_project
cmake -G"CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles" ..
```

For other IDE please refer to this [guide](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html).
Alternatively you can refer to this [Issue Page](https://github.com/district10/cmake-templates/issues/2#issue-154178247).

### 2.2. Generating Builds

If you want to skip generating project files,
you may use `cmake` to generate build files.
For that use the following commands.

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

This will create an executable file in your `build` folder.
If you are on Unix system, you may run it by 

```bash
./c4web
```

CMake will by default build Debug builds.
If you want Release or Minified Release builds
please use the following commands.

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel ..
make clean
make
```

## 3. Examples

### 3.1. Hello World

```C
#include "framework/c4web.h"

void hello_world(http_request request);

int main(){
    start_server(7071);
    return 0;
}

void router(http_request request){
    if(router_match(request, "hello-world")){
        hello_world(request);
    }
}

void hello_world(http_request request){
    char sample_response[12] = "Hello World";
    http_send_text(request, sample_response);
}
```
